The real estate market in Australia grows every year since the financial crisis in 2008. There are a lot of factors needs to be considered when people invest in real estate. The hedonic house price model (HPM) estimates the value of properties by adding separate propertiesâ€™ attributes. Locational attributes and neighboured characteristics are major concerns when applying HPM on the study of the association between external factors and the house value. By using techniques and tools like the AURIN platform, Jupyter notebook, this project provides a system to understand the status of the current house market in Victoria state, and the associations between house price increase rate and locational attributes. Multiple statistical methods like Maximum information coefficient, ordinary least squares, Pearson's correlation coefficient are used in the analysis to test the correlation between house price increase rate and targeted factors. The results of this project show that some locational variables and neighbourhood characteristics are correlated with the house price increase rate in Victoria state.
