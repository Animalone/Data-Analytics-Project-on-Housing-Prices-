This dataset is based on the 2016 Statistical Area Level 2 boundaries, and covers data for individual years between 2011 and 2016. The dataset includes information in the following specified areas of community and environment: Travel Methods, Households, Marital Status, Internet Access, Rent and Mortgage Payments, Unpaid Work, Count of Children, Dwelling Structure, Land Area, Protected Land Areas, Solar Installations and Water Use.<br/><br/>\n\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available. All data presented are on geographic boundaries as described in the 2016 edition of the ASGS.<br/><br/>\n\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 1410.0) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1410.0Explanatory%20Notes12011-16?OpenDocument#FAMILY\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nNotes: \n<ul>\n<li>Some data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"year","type":"Integer","title":"Year","description":"year","stype":"ordinal","categories":[{"key":"2011","label":"2011"},{"key":"2012","label":"2012"},{"key":"2013","label":"2013"},{"key":"2014","label":"2014"},{"key":"2015","label":"2015"},{"key":"2016","label":"2016"}],"filterValue":"2016","isDimension":true},{"name":"sa2_main16","type":"String","title":"SA2 Code 2016","description":"sa2_main16","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa2_name16","type":"String","title":"SA2 Name 2016","description":"sa2_name16","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"prtc_nat_park_cnt","type":"Integer","title":"Protected Areas - National Parks (no.)","description":"prtc_nat_park_cnt","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"prtc_indg_natr_rsrv_cnt","type":"Integer","title":"Protected Areas - Nature Reserves (no.)","description":"prtc_indg_natr_rsrv_cnt","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"prtc_nat_park_%","type":"Double","title":"Protected Areas - National Parks (%)","description":"prtc_nat_park_%","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"prtc_indg_natr_rsrv_%","type":"Double","title":"Protected Areas - Nature Reserves (%)","description":"prtc_indg_natr_rsrv_%","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"prtc_tot_%","type":"Double","title":"Protected Areas - Total (%)","description":"prtc_tot_%","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"prtc_tot_cnt","type":"Integer","title":"Protected Areas - Total (no.)","description":"prtc_tot_cnt","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","where":"(year IN ('2016'))","feature":{"key":"sa2_main16","geoLevel":"sa2_2016","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[140.961681984,-39.159189527500004,149.976679008,-33.9806475865],"featureType":"ste","featureInstance":"2","featureName":"Victoria","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
