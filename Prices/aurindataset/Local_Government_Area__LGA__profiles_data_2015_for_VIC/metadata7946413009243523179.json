The profiles provide measures on a broad range of topics including: population, diversity, disadvantage and social engagement, housing, transport and education, health status and service utilisation, child and family characteristics and service utilisation. Rankings are provided to enable comparison of LGAs, along with the Victorian averages. The profiles are structured to provide a measure on each variable for each Local Government Area (LGA), and to also enable comparisons by providing rankings against all Local Government Areas as well as the Victorian measure. Profiles are also provided for former Department of Health regions, as well as the former Department of Human Services operational service areas and divisions.
